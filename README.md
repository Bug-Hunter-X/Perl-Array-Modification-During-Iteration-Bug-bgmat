This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: modifying an array while iterating over it using a traditional for loop and the $#array method. The bug.pl file contains the erroneous code, which skips elements unexpectedly when removing an element. The bugSolution.pl file provides a corrected version using a `foreach` loop or a `grep` solution, which safely removes the element without index issues.
